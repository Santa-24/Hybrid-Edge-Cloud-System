📘 SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS SPECIFICATION (SRS)
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a Hybrid Edge–Cloud Intelligent Risk Detection System that can detect risky situations using a camera, process data locally on the edge (laptop), and trigger real-world actions using an ESP32-controlled relay.
The system focuses on real-time response, offline functionality, and practical hardware integration, making it suitable for real-world safety and automation scenarios.

1.2 Scope
The system captures live video from a camera, performs basic vision-based detection on the laptop, classifies the situation into predefined risk levels, and communicates the risk to an ESP32 microcontroller via serial communication.
Based on the received risk level, the ESP32 controls a relay module to switch external devices (alarm, light, cutoff switch).
An optional cloud (MQTT) component is included for monitoring and logging but is not mandatory for core operation.
