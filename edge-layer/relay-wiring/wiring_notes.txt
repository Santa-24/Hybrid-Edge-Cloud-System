## Demo Script (15 minutes total)

### Introduction (2 minutes)
**Speaker: Member 1 or Team Leader**

"Welcome! Today we're presenting our Hybrid Edge-Cloud System - an intelligent IoT solution that combines edge computing with cloud intelligence for real-time security monitoring."

**Show Architecture Diagram**
- Point out 3 layers: Edge, Cloud, Dashboard
- Explain data flow: Camera → ESP32 → MQTT → Cloud → Dashboard

### Part 1: Edge Layer Demo (4 minutes)
**Speaker: Member 1**

**Start Camera Detection:**
```bash
cd edge-layer/camera-detection
python main.py
```

"This is our edge layer running on a laptop. It:"
1. Captures video from the camera
2. Detects motion using computer vision
3. Calculates risk scores in real-time
4. Sends alerts to ESP32

**Demo Actions:**
- Wave hand in front of camera (LOW risk)
- Move object quickly (MEDIUM risk)
- Create rapid motion with multiple objects (HIGH risk)

"Notice the risk score increases with more motion. When risk is significant, data is sent to the ESP32."

**Show Serial Monitor:**
"Here you can see the ESP32 receiving commands via serial communication."

**Demo Relay:**
- Create high-risk motion
- Point out relay clicking ON
- Show LED indicator changing

### Part 2: Cloud Layer Demo (4 minutes)
**Speaker: Member 2**

**Start MQTT Subscriber:**
```bash
cd cloud-layer/mqtt-communication
python mqtt_subscriber.py
```

"This is our cloud layer. It receives events from the ESP32 via MQTT."

**Show Terminal Output:**
"Notice the cloud:"
1. Receives the event from ESP32
2. Re-classifies risk using cloud intelligence
3. Makes informed decisions on actions
4. Stores events in database

**Speaker: Member 3**

"Our cloud intelligence adds extra layers:"
- Enhanced risk classification
- Context-aware decisions (time of day, location)
- Optional ML model for improved accuracy
- Smart alert management to prevent spam

**Show CSV File:**
```bash
cat cloud-layer/storage/events.csv
```

"All events are logged for analysis and compliance."

### Part 3: Dashboard Demo (3 minutes)
**Speaker: Member 4**

**Show Dashboard (projected on screen):**

"This is our real-time monitoring dashboard accessible from any device."

**Point out features:**
1. Current Status - shows live risk level
2. Device Status - ESP32 connection
3. Statistics - 24-hour analytics
4. Recent Events - scrolling event log

**Create some events:**
- Member 1 creates motion
- Watch dashboard update in real-time
- Point out alert banner appearing

**Demo Manual Controls:**
- Click "Turn Relay ON"
- Show relay activating
- Click "Turn Relay OFF"

"This gives security personnel manual override capabilities."

### Part 4: System Integration (2 minutes)
**Speaker: Team Leader**

**Show Complete Flow:**
1. Create motion in front of camera
2. Point to each component as data flows:
   - Camera detects → Python calculates
   - Python → ESP32 (serial)
   - ESP32 → Relay (hardware)
   - ESP32 → Cloud (MQTT)
   - Cloud → Dashboard (real-time)

"This demonstrates the complete system working together:"
- **Edge**: Fast, local processing
- **Cloud**: Intelligent decision-making
- **Dashboard**: User-friendly monitoring

### Conclusion & Q&A (remaining time)

**Highlight Key Features:**
- ✅ Real-time processing at the edge
- ✅ Cloud intelligence with ML capabilities
- ✅ Scalable architecture (MQTT)
- ✅ Professional dashboard interface
- ✅ Hardware integration (relay control)
- ✅ Event logging and analytics

**Potential Applications:**
- Security systems
- Smart buildings
- Industrial monitoring
- Traffic management
- Elderly care monitoring

**Open for Questions**

## Common Q&A

### Q: How fast is the system response?
**A:** Edge processing is near-instant (<100ms). Cloud processing adds 500ms-1s depending on network.

### Q: Can it scale to multiple cameras?
**A:** Yes! Each camera runs its own edge detection, all publish to the same MQTT broker.

### Q: What about false positives?
**A:** The cloud intelligence layer helps reduce false positives through context-aware classification and ML.

### Q: How is data secured?
**A:** MQTT supports TLS encryption. Add authentication tokens for production.

### Q: What happens if cloud connection is lost?
**A:** Edge layer continues to work independently, controlling the relay locally.

### Q: Can we add other sensors?
**A:** Absolutely! The architecture is modular - just add more publishers to MQTT.

## Backup Plans

### If Camera Fails:
- Use pre-recorded video
- Show simulation mode in dashboard
- Explain with architecture diagram

### If ESP32 Disconnects:
- Show Python sending commands in simulation mode
- Demonstrate cloud layer independently
- Use dashboard simulation

### If MQTT Broker Down:
- Run dashboard in standalone simulation mode
- Show edge layer working independently
- Explain normal flow with diagrams

### If Demo Computer Crashes:
- Have backup laptop with everything ready
- Keep architecture slides ready
- Team members explain verbally
